# Sophos

This repository is a structured resource for exploring and mastering the next generation features of the Sophos Firewall platform. It contains step-by-step lab journals, configuration walkthroughs, and explanatory notes aimed at building both practical skills and conceptual understanding.

## What This Repository Contains

- **Lab Journals:** Hands-on guides for configuring Sophos Firewall features, written in a conversational style with placeholders for verification screenshots.  
- **Configuration Walkthroughs:** GUI-based workflows for common setups such as rules and policies, DHCP, DNS, VPNs, and advanced security features.  
- **Feature Explanations:** Expanded notes on why each feature is used, best practices for secure deployment, and real-world use cases.  
- **Troubleshooting Sections:** Common pitfalls, verification commands, and client-side checks for each lab.  
- **Progressive Topics:** Each lab builds on the previous one, moving from foundational configurations into advanced controls like web policies, SSL/TLS inspection, and IPS.

## Purpose of This Repository

This project serves as my personal knowledge base as I work through **Sophos Firewall labs** with a focus on next-gen features. By documenting each step and expanding on the concepts behind them, the goal is to:

- Build practical skills in Sophos administration and security policy design  
- Consolidate lab work into a structured, searchable reference  
- Provide a resource that others can follow to replicate or learn from these labs

## Topics Covered

- Rules and Policies  
- DHCP and DNS Services  
- Web Policies (coming soon)  
- SSL/TLS Decryption and Inspection  
- IPS and Advanced Threat Protection  
- VPN Configurations  
- Identity and User-Based Policies  

---

This repository will be continuously updated as I progress through the labs. Suggestions, corrections, and contributions are welcome.

Do you want me to also **add a “Repository Structure” section** (for example: `/journal`, `/configs`, `/screenshots`) like we might do later with CCNP_Security, or should we keep it simple for now and expand as you add more labs?
